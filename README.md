# Psi-score

Metric of user influence in Online Social Networks

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install psi-score
```

## Usage

```python
>>> from psi_score import PsiScore
>>> adjacency = {0: [1, 3], 1: [0, 2], 2: [0, 1, 3], 3: [0]}
>>> lambdas = [0.23, 0.50, 0.86, 0.19]
>>> mus = [0.42, 0.17, 0.10, 0.37]
>>> psiscore = PsiScore()
>>> scores = psiscore.fit_transform(adjacency, lambdas, mus)
>>> scores
array([0.21158803, 0.35253745, 0.28798439, 0.14789014])
>>> np.round(scores, 2)
array([0.21, 0.35, 0.29, 0.15])
```
You can use another algorithm than the default one as well as the tolerance:
```python
>>> psiscore = PsiScore(solver='power_nf', n_iter=500, tol=1e-3)
>>> scores = psiscore.fit_transform(adjacency, lambdas, mus)
```
